## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I’m **Ashfak Yeafi**, a graduate researcher in **Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering** at **Michigan State University (MSU)**, where I work under the guidance of [**Prof. Yuzhen Lu**](https://www.yuzhenlu.com/). My research focuses on integrating **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Hyperspectral Light Scattering Imaging** to develop **non-invasive methods for early-stage rot detection in fruits**, particularly blueberries. This work aims to revolutionize quality control in the agricultural supply chain using advanced **machine learning**, **computer vision**, and **spectral analysis** techniques.

My long-term goal is to pursue a **Ph.D. in Computer Science or AI**, with a focus on **vision-language models**, **generative AI**, and **transformer architectures** applied to medical and agricultural imaging.
